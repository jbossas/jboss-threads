     * the implementation of this method <em>should</em> {@linkplain LockSupport#parkNanos(long) park} for some amount of time before returning.
     * While the event loop method is parked,
     * other threads will be allowed to run.
     * If the set of ready threads is exhausted before that time elapses,
     * the event loop thread will automatically be unparked,
     * allowing the loop to be re-entered from the top to wait for ready events.

     * Note that {@linkplain Thread#sleep(long) sleeping} instead of parking may cause latency spikes,
     * so it is not recommended.
